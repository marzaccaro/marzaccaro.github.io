I am Martina, a business intelligence analyst, based in London.

I have a background in Mathematics, and always loved its abstraction and power to formalise complex quantitative problems.

I love data visualisation, because it brings together creativity, design and science.

This blog is a way to share my thoughts around data, hoping to sparkle some interesting considerations around data analytics. 

I am originally from Italy and a foodie, so this name couldn't fit more.
