<p>Last week I was visiting this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.museibassano.it/collezione/museo-della-stampa-remondini" target="_blank">museum</a> about the history of invention and development of printing in Bassano Del Grappa, a small little village in the North of Italy. The museum was really well presented and it reminded me how the introduction of printing marked a revolution: more and more books were available and the knowledge was faster to spread.</p>

<p>The museum focus was about the Remondini’s: a famous family running a publishing business, particularly active in the ‘700 and based in Bassano. Historians knew it was flourishing, because it was the main reproducer of a satiric depiction called the Juicio Universal, that was widespread and talked about in all the Catholic countries. To point out how wide was the reach of the prints, a panel in the museum proposed this chart</p>

<p>And I decided to use this post as a commentary and an opportunity for a make over.</p>

<h4 id="why-the-3d-pie-chart-does-not-fit-for-purpose">Why the 3D pie chart does not fit for purpose?</h4>

<p>Looking at the panel I find myself going back and forth between the chart and the legend, struggling to understand what the aim of the chart is and I actually start looking at <em>Svizzera</em> and then look back to the <em>Impero</em> because the colours are so similar. Here some more reasons why this chart is not a good choice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Too many colours make it hard to decide which is which clearly</li>
  <li><em>Spagna</em> looks bigger than <em>Stato Pontificio</em>, even though the latter is 1% bigger in reality: this is due to the deformation caused by the 3D effect</li>
  <li>At a glance I cannot understand what is going on and I need to read the whole legend.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-are-better-options">What are better options?</h4>

<p>What alternative can I use to display the data? Of course the answer is <strong>it depends!</strong> On what – I heard you asking? – on the message you’re trying to convey.</p>

<p>If it is important to <strong>compare</strong> how many of the reproductions were going in each region, I would use a <strong>bar chart</strong>, maybe highlighting the top region, like in the image below.</p>

<figure class="figure  figure--center">
  <img class="image" src="/assets/uploads/bar-chart.png" alt="Bar chart, the difference between the regions is now clear and there is no need for a legend." width="570" height="336" />
  <figcaption class="caption">Bar chart, the difference between the regions is now clear and there is no need for a legend.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If instead is important to mark that <strong>so many different regions</strong> were receiving these reproductions I would just list the number of different end markets and compare it to the number of existing regions at that time. Or alternatively give a <strong>sentence</strong> like <em>X% of the number of books circulating in Europe where produced from Remondini</em>, something along the line of this</p>

<figure class="figure  figure--center">
  <img class="image" src="/assets/uploads/single-value-chart.png" alt="Sometimes a sentence with the main numbers is more effective. Note: these numbers are made up" width="498" height="127" />
  <figcaption class="caption">Sometimes a sentence with the main numbers is more effective. Note: these numbers are made up</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To summarise the nature of this data-set makes it hard to choose a pie chart, both because the number of colours is too high and because some of the slices’ sizes are so similar. The 3D effect does not help – distorting the proportion of the real numbers. Curious to see when is a good idea to use a pie chart?
