I"<h4 id="the-inspiration">The inspiration</h4>

<p>It all started with a workshop on <strong>how to create an effective chart</strong> by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic at the <a href="https://usergroups.tableau.com/london" target="_blank">Tableau User Group London</a>. It was so inspiring and captivating, she managed to engage the public asking for their own recommendations and ideas. I thought to <strong>do the same in my company</strong>, as we have a big data team and we encourage the business to use a self-serve platform to answer their own data questions.</p>

<p>To start with, I read again <a href="http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/" target="_blank">Storytelling with data</a>. The book is a great starting point for anyone who wants to enhance their ability to use data visualisation and storytelling to bring people to action, once they have a good point supported by data. It was the second time I read it, and every time its clarity and effectiveness amaze me.</p>

<h4 id="the-planning">The planning</h4>

<p>I wanted to copy the same structure she used, but then I felt my level wasn’t quite the same and I wanted to add my own personal experience to the presentation, to make it more compelling. Like she illustrates in her book I started off with a bunch of post-it on a wall: <strong>creating the structure of your presentation with sticky notes or on a whiteboard</strong>, you don’t grow attached to your work and you have more flexibility and freedom to arrange it.</p>

<p>After this exercise I knew the outline of my presentation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why storytelling with data</li>
  <li>How to tell a good story with your data using the steps from the book</li>
  <li>Workshop / practical part</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-final-presentation">The final presentation</h4>

<p>Only then, I start refining the sections one by one. For the <strong>why</strong> I wanted to highlight why using a story is effective and the power of data visualisation to see patterns and trends at a glance. In the <strong>how to</strong> I wanted to follow the principles in the book Storytelling with data:
&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understand the context</li>
  <li>Choose an appropriate display</li>
  <li>Eliminate clutter</li>
  <li>Draw attention where you want it</li>
  <li>Think like a designer</li>
  <li>Tell a story</li>
</ul>

<p>The main section has to be the 2, which includes a selection of widely used charts and when to use them. The final result was well received and – I hope – <strong>increased awareness around data visualisation</strong> when presenting a business case.</p>

<p>The final result is below.</p>
