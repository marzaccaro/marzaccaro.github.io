<p>I am Martina, a business intelligence analyst, based in London.</p>

<p>I have a background in Mathematics, and always loved its abstraction and power to formalise complex quantitative problems.</p>

<p>I love data visualisation, because it brings together creativity, design and science.</p>

<p>This blog is a way to share my thoughts around data, hoping to sparkle some interesting considerations around data analytics.</p>

<p>I am originally from Italy and a foodie, so this name couldn’t fit more.</p>
