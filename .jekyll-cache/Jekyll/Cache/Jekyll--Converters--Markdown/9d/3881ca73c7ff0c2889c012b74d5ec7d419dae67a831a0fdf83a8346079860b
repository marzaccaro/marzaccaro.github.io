<p>Often you <strong>learn more talking with people</strong> and sharing your experience than studying on your own. In London, there are plenty of opportunities for networking and knowledge sharing and my favourite place is definitely <a href="http://tinytableautalks.com/">Tiny Tableau Talks</a>, a selection of 5 minutes talks about data visualisation and storytelling. I love it so...
