<p>One of my favourite author about data visualisation, Cole N. Knaflic, published a new book <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119621496/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?imprToken=MXc2dye5HuMafi41a0kHIA&amp;slotNum=2&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1119621496&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;linkId=c74bc50a287b2986edae7e3b95f9f5f4&amp;tag=storytellingwithdata-20" target="_blank">Storytelling with data: Letâ€™s Practice!</a></em></p>

<p>I am keen of getting my own copy, but while waiting I decided to take part in this month challenge. If youâ€™re interested too, she launch one every month on her <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="website.

<p>This is the extract from the latest post. Iâ€™ll follow the steps.</p>

<h4 id="step-1">Step 1</h4>

<p>My assumptions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The tiers are ordered by best to last (A to D)</li>
  <li>As the sum of % of Accounts doesnâ€™t sum up to 100% and neither the % Revenue â€“ either I have missing tiers or this is the just the new clients, but then Iâ€™ve just had a really good year if my revenue growth has been so big.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would ask where the is the revenue missing to the 100%.</p>

<h4 id="step-2">Step 2</h4>

<p>This is how I re-designed the table using Google Sheets.</p>

<figure class="figure  figure--center">
  <img class="image" src="/assets/uploads/swd-challenge-my-table.png" alt="My re-desing" width="797" height="300" />
  <figcaption class="caption">My re-desing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here is the list of actions, and my thoughts behind them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Kept the order of the tiers, assuming the order have a meaning</li>
  <li>Right align the numbers and percentage â€“ to make the scan and comparison quicker for the reader</li>
  <li>Delete background in the titles as the contrast wasnâ€™t great for readability</li>
  <li>Remove the alternate line background, as the new line separation is already enough</li>
  <li>Added the unit and currency to each value in the table â€“ to make it clear we are talking Million $, and remove it from the title as unnecessary</li>
  <li>Added the Other tier â€“ so that we have the whole and not just part of it, this is following my assumption at step 1.</li>
  <li>I made the % italic, to sort of create a link between numbers and related %</li>
  <li>Use the default font of Google sheet, for consistency.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="step-3">Step 3</h4>

<p>The title of the table and the exercise suggest to look at the tier share in terms of number of accounts and revenue, and compare those two.</p>

<p>I decided to stick with a simple visual, a column chart where I compare only the revenue and account share for the top tiers (so I excluded the Other bucket).</p>

<figure class="figure  figure--center">
  <img class="image" src="/assets/uploads/swd-challenge-my-chart.png" alt="Chart to compare accounts share and revenue share" width="835" height="475" />
  <figcaption class="caption">Chart to compare accounts share and revenue share</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Again I used Google Sheet, selecting the column chart and putting the two share % side to side for an easier comparison.</p>

<p>I put the legend on the top left, to be picked up first thing by the user and kept the order of the tiers.</p>

<p>Now having them side to side I can see how A, A+ are giving most of the revenue, while forming only 9% of all accounts. While C, D give 17% of the revenue, but has 4 times more accounts.</p>

<p>I went for a black and grey version, bit old style and boring, but as effective â€“ and will be the same if printed!</p>

<p>The link with both the data, the table and the chart can be found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mFxZeLLoquP5pmk4zS6HnpXolK-Ib1DI/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>. Hope you find this post useful, I will submit this on the SWDchallenge!</p>
