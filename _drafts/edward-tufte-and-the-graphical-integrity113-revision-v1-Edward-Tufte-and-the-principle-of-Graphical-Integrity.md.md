#### **My favourite meet up in London**

Often you **learn more talking with people** and sharing your experience than studying on your own. I totally embrace this and in London, there are plenty of opportunities for networking and knowledge sharing, my favourite place is definitely [Tiny Tableau Talks](http://tinytableautalks.com/), a selection of 5 minutes talks about data visualisation and storytelling. I love it so much because:

  * In 5 minutes you have to keep it short and often you go straight to the main point
  * Most of the talks are useful tips
  * It is open to anyone, not just the experts, as long as you have something interesting to share
  * Even if most of the talks are about Tableau, the lessons you learn are often generic and applicable to any data visualisation tool you’re using
  * The organisers are great and help you getting ready to give a talk.

#### **My experience**

I’ve been to some of these meet-ups and learned so much, that I felt I have to give back to the community and do my own tiny talk. I am particularly fascinated by history in general because I like to know how and why things are the way they are, when did they change, when people started to formalise some concepts and why? **Data visualisation** is not different, and despite being a recent field it **has an awesome history** to discover.

#### **Choosing&nbsp;the&nbsp;subject**

One of the pioneers in data visualisation and graphical representation of information is Edward Tufte, and I loved his masterpiece _<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="The display of quantitative information (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi" target="_blank">The display of quantitative information</a>_, which is included by Amazon in the top 100 books of the 20th century. He formalised all the principle of Data Visualisation before digital tools to represent data were popular and mostly journalists where using charts to make news more informative. I then asked myself: **which of Tufte’s lessons &#8211; born in paper design &#8211; are still applicable in <g class="gr_ gr\_29 gr-alert gr\_spell gr\_inline\_cards gr\_run\_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="29" data-gr-id="29">digital</g> design?**

#### The principle of graphical integrity

The first principle illustrated by Tufte is the principle of graphical integrity, which is asking for truthfulness in data representation. The main points are:

  * Graphic should respect the proportions of the numbers they represent
  * Use labelling to help understanding
  * Show data variation, not design variation
  * When displaying monetary variation over time is better to standardise the units (e.g. consider inflation)
  * Don’t use more dimensions than the ones included in the chart
  * Don’t quote data out of context

**My thoughts on Tufte <g class="gr_ gr\_54 gr-alert gr\_spell gr\_inline\_cards gr\_run\_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="54" data-gr-id="54">book</g>**<g class="gr_ gr\_54 gr-alert gr\_spell gr\_inline\_cards gr\_disable\_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="54" data-gr-id="54">I</g> agree on the principle, but sometimes they appear as prescriptive. Of course it is a good idea to have the basic rules, but sometimes you can break them making a deliberately and justifiable design choice.The book is addressing mainly journalists and designer, that’s why there is a deviation to a scientific approach. Nonetheless in reality there is a need for a catchy and pleasant visualisation, the user not need only to have the true data but satisfy and catch the eyes of the reader &#8211; especially now that we are bombarded with reading opportunities one need to be careful not only to the truth, but also to the appearance
