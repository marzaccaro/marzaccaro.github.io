The annual Looker Conference this year happened remotely, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://looker.com/events/join-2020" target="_blank">JOIN@Home 2020</a>. Last year I have been to the conference in San Francisco, and the vibe was of course so much better last year: networking, meeting people, data parties: all so thrilling. Still I get excited about learning some more inspiring ideas from Looker pros and other Looker clients, and understand where the product is going and what is on the road map.

The fact that Google is owning Looker is clearer than ever: especially on the design and on the form, nonetheless the tool is staying cloud agnostic, with many customer using a database different from Big Query and the Google Cloud infrastructure.

This year I got again the confirmation that Looker truly want to build a platform, and make their offering as much flexible as possible. Not everyone use data in the same way and have the same attitude towards exploring data, sometimes they just want to know.

Being flexible is a way to be emphatic: offering both a ready to use product, and 100% API coverage, so more tech savvy company can pick and choose part of the software and adapt it to their needs. Emblematic on this is one of the latest Looker feature, the [extension framework](https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/extension-framework/extension-framework-intro). This is a toolbox that allows to build web-application integrating and reusing Looker components in different applications. 

I can really see an investment on Looker as a product: more offering in terms of visualisations but also some simplification of the UI: for example the web IDE got a big remake and it was quite insightful to see the reasoning behind the new and improved IDE: in particular I like a lot the new <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/getting-started/object-browser" target="_blank">object browser</a> with gives you the hierarchical view of model, explore, view, field in the same place and makes the navigation of your LookML a lot easier.

#### Training instances vs reality.

Every time you go to a workshop or training you use a training instance of the product, that you&#8217;ll use to experiment. This time was no different: a couple of models with 5 explore each, or in general a very neat situation; and then the reality of your company is closer to 100+ models, some of which were set up by people who left. This is because effectively the BI platforms and the reporting tools in general need to be treated as a product: they live and evolve as the business that use them grows and expand. Furthermore every company function comes to the table with different angles and perspective and want to get something different from the data.

I think is hard to come up with the perfect plan, but there are a couple of ideas 

  * having guidlines, same style of developing helps navigate the content even if it&#8217;s loads
  * discerning ad-hoc from widely used and keep the ad-hoc as non-exploratory complex vs easy for the exploratory wide usage 

Guidelines: they are like a no brainer &#8211; if you have them it&#8217;s like steve jobs having already his clothes ready and frees up time for thinking to other things, because the basics like how to call the PR, how to lint, how to create the lookML are ready for you!

#### Best new features for developers. 

Aggregate Awareness: I think it allows for new form of flexibility on cases where you want to have all in one level you don&#8217;t need to aggregate &#8211; so you have detail and group at the same level. 

MAD Framework is still possible.

I am also intribued by the extension framework: playing with the SDK I understood the power of the API , and the fact that Looker have 100% API coverage is really interesting because it allows you to do anything you do with tick boxes and form on the web UI programmatically

Advantage of coding via text vs web UI and drag and drop: it truly is more flexible and you have more control about what is going on!

Article in medium about for example how to change one color, and this is true for Looker too, the fact that they have both UI dashboard and LookML Dashboard make the creation of the content programmatic, and bulk changes easier (same thing for Oracle BI where each report had an XML definition): so we have to have both and that is the main drawback of tools like Tableau where the tool is interface first.

#### Training and conference remotely.

  * being funny or try to entertain makes the lessons shorter and more enjoyable 
  * it&#8217;s hard to make people socialise, unless you are intentional about it
  * repeat the questions it&#8217;s being asked &#8211; this makes feels better the audience, because it makes the question clearer and it gives time to the trainer to think to a proper answer
  * not rushing through the answer, but giving the whys and the process that you would use to troubleshoot and verify what is going on is really valuable, so I appreciate instructors that offer the process to get to the answers as well as the answer
  * Some choices on the product makes for some unexpected user behaviour: example default setting of the daily schedules to 6am or the fact that roles comes before groups in the Admin settings.
  * thank you to all the instructors: Bernard, Mike, Eric, Rebecca &#8211; they were all great! Link
  * Idea of making announcement being more mindful about product announcement
  * I like the watch video at your own pace
  * Defo against doing again a conference on a different timezone ðŸ™‚ maybe because I was in Italy I did it 2pm to 11pm, and found that on day 2 I wasn&#8217;t really paying the attention of day 1.
