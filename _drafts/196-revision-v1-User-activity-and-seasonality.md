Explain why is good to use a heatmap to show hot spots for hour of the day and day of the week

Is it good to see trend though? The shape of the trend

Use the data set here <https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/number-bicycle-hires> instead of the hour of day vs day of the week, use day of the week and month &#8211; will do the same thing &#8211; just at a different level. You have the same issue that an average by day of the week is not representative of the whole year > ex. I expect summer month to have more hires than the summer. you need to join this data set to another to get public holidays etc? maybe? yes!

Not sure I need it though

I have 1 chart showing the average users by day of the week 

1 chart showing the average users by month

show the 2 together with an heatmap 

explain other application: example day of the week and hour of the day instead of averages

explain how seasonality can impact everything
