#### The inspiration

It all started with a workshop on **how to create an effective chart** by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic at the [Tableau User Group London](https://usergroups.tableau.com/london){:target="_blank"}. It was so inspiring and captivating, she managed to engage the public asking for their own recommendations and ideas. I thought to **do the same in my company**, as we have a big data team and we encourage the business to use a self-serve platform to answer their own data questions.

To start with, I read again [Storytelling with data](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/){:target="_blank"}. The book is a great starting point for anyone who wants to enhance their ability to use data visualisation and storytelling to bring people to action, once they have a good point supported by data. It was the second time I read it, and every time its clarity and effectiveness amaze me. 

#### The planning

I wanted to copy the same structure she used, but then I felt my level wasn't quite the same and I wanted to add my own personal experience to the presentation, to make it more compelling. Like she illustrates in her book I started off with a bunch of post-it on a wall: **creating the structure of your presentation with sticky notes or on a whiteboard**, you don't grow attached to your work and you have more flexibility and freedom to arrange it.

After this exercise I knew the outline of my presentation:

  * Why storytelling with data
  * How to tell a good story with your data using the steps from the book
  * Workshop / practical part

#### The final presentation


Only then, I start refining the sections one by one. For the <strong>why</strong> I wanted to highlight why using a story is effective and the power of data visualisation to see patterns and trends at a glance. In the <strong>how to</strong> I wanted to follow the principles in the book Storytelling with data:
</p>

  * Understand the context
  * Choose an appropriate display
  * Eliminate clutter
  * Draw attention where you want it
  * Think like a designer
  * Tell a story

The main section has to be the 2, which includes a selection of widely used charts and when to use them. The final result was well received and -- I hope -- **increased awareness around data visualisation** when presenting a business case.

The final result is below.
