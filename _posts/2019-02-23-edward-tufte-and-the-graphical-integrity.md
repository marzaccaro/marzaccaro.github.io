#### **My favourite meet up in London**

Often you **learn more talking with people** and sharing your experience than studying on your own. In London, there are plenty of opportunities for networking and knowledge sharing and my favourite place is definitely [Tiny Tableau Talks](http://tinytableautalks.com/), a selection of 5 minutes talks about data visualisation and storytelling. I love it so much because:

  * In 5 minutes you have to keep it short and often you go straight to the core concept
  * Most of the talks are useful tips
  * It is open to anyone, not just the experts, as long as you have something interesting to share
  * Even if most of the talks are about Tableau, the lessons you learn are often generic and applicable to any data visualisation tool you’re using
  * The organisers are great and help you to get ready to give a talk.

#### **My experience**

I’ve been to some of these meet-ups and learned so much, that I felt I have to give back to the community and do my own tiny talk. I am particularly fascinated by history in general because I like to know how and why things are the way they are, when did they change, when people started to formalise some concepts and why? **Data visualisation** is not different, and despite being a recent field it **has an awesome history** to discover.

#### **Choosing the subject**

</div>

One of the pioneers in data visualisation and graphical representation of information is Edward Tufte, and I loved his masterpiece _<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="The display of quantitative information (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi" target="_blank">The display of quantitative information</a>_, which is included by Amazon in the top 100 books of the 20th century. 

He formalised a <g class="gr_ gr\_62 gr-alert gr\_gramm gr\_inline\_cards gr\_run\_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="62" data-gr-id="62">lot</g> of principles of Data Visualisation before digital tools were so popular and <g class="gr_ gr\_17 gr-alert gr\_spell gr\_inline\_cards gr\_run\_anim ContextualSpelling" id="17" data-gr-id="17">mostly</g> journalists were using charts to make news more informative. 

I then asked myself: **which of Tufte’s lessons &#8211; born in paper design &#8211; are still applicable in digital design?**

#### **The principle of graphical integrity**

The first principle illustrated by Tufte is the principle of graphical integrity, which is pushing for truthfulness in data representation. The core <g class="gr_ gr\_63 gr-alert gr\_spell gr\_inline\_cards gr\_run\_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="63" data-gr-id="63">eleme</g>nts are:

  * Graphic should respect the proportions of the numbers they represent
  * Use labelling to help understanding
  * Show data variation, not design variation
  * When displaying monetary variation over time, is better to standardise the units (e.g. consider inflation)
  * Don’t use more dimensions than the ones included in the chart (avoid 3D)
  * Don’t quote data out of context

#### **The content of my presentation**

I couldn&#8217;t include all these in 5 minutes, so I cut down to three points and included a practical example for each of them. You can find the final result in the video below.<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">

#### **My thoughts on Tufte&#8217;s book**

In my opinion, the book is addressing mainly journalists and designer, that’s why there is such a prescriptive approach. Nonetheless &#8211; especially now that we are bombarded with reading opportunities &#8211; journalists and designers need to capture the eyes of the reader, with both truthful and visually appealing representations.  


#### **More learning along the way**

Googling around _Data Visualisation History_ you can find this amazing project to outline a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="timeline with milestones (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.datavis.ca/milestones/" target="_blank">timeline with milestones</a> of the history of data visualization, by Michael Friendly along with his books, papers and presentations. Here are some curiosities: the bar, line and pie chart were all introduced by William Playfair in the 18th century, whereas Tufte is the inventor of the sparkline, that was first used in 2004.
