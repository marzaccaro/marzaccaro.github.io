#### My favourite meet up in London

Often you **learn more talking with people** and sharing your experience than studying on your own. In London, there are plenty of opportunities for networking and knowledge sharing and my favourite place is definitely [Tiny Tableau Talks](http://tinytableautalks.com/), a selection of 5 minutes talks about data visualisation and storytelling. I love it so much because:

  - In 5 minutes you have to keep it short and often you go straight to the core concept
  - Most of the talks are useful tips
  - It is open to anyone, not just the experts, as long as you have something interesting to share
  - Even if most of the talks are about Tableau, the lessons you learn are often generic and applicable to any data visualisation tool you’re using
  - The organisers are great and help you to get ready to give a talk.

#### My experience

I’ve been to some of these meet-ups and learned so much, that I felt I have to give back to the community and do my own tiny talk. I am particularly fascinated by history in general because I like to know how and why things are the way they are, when did they change, when people started to formalise some concepts and why? **Data visualisation** is not different, and despite being a recent field it **has an awesome history** to discover.

#### Choosing the subject

One of the pioneers in data visualisation and graphical representation of information is Edward Tufte, and I loved his masterpiece [_The display of quantitative information_](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi), which is included by Amazon in the top 100 books of the 20th century.

He formalised a lot of principles of Data Visualisation before digital tools were so popular and mostly journalists were using charts to make news more informative. 

I then asked myself: **which of Tufte’s lessons &#8211; born in paper design &#8211; are still applicable in digital design?**

#### The principle of graphical integrity

The first principle illustrated by Tufte is the principle of graphical integrity, which is pushing for truthfulness in data representation. The core elements are:

  * Graphic should respect the proportions of the numbers they represent
  * Use labelling to help understanding
  * Show data variation, not design variation
  * When displaying monetary variation over time, is better to standardise the units (e.g. consider inflation)
  * Don’t use more dimensions than the ones included in the chart (avoid 3D)
  * Don’t quote data out of context

#### The content of my presentation

I couldn't include all these in 5 minutes, so I cut down to three points and included a practical example for each of them. You can find the final result in the video below.

#### My thoughts on Tufte&#8217;s book

In my opinion, the book is addressing mainly journalists and designer, that’s why there is such a prescriptive approach. Nonetheless &#8211; especially now that we are bombarded with reading opportunities &#8211; journalists and designers need to capture the eyes of the reader, with both truthful and visually appealing representations.  


#### More learning along the way

Googling around _Data Visualisation History_ you can find this amazing project to outline a [timeline with milestones](http://www.datavis.ca/milestones/) of the history of data visualization, by Michael Friendly along with his books, papers and presentations. Here are some curiosities: the bar, line and pie chart were all introduced by William Playfair in the 18th century, whereas Tufte is the inventor of the sparkline, that was first used in 2004.
